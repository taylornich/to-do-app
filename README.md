The To-Do list application is a very basic command-line tool that allows you to run basic tasks pertaining to a to-do list. 
The functions of this application include adding a task, viewing the task list, marking tasks as complete, deleting tasks and quitting the application. 
When adding a task, the application marks the task as incomplete by default, only changing once the user commands. 
When viewing the tasks, the application will display their complete or incomplete status. 
When executing the application, a menu will display; once the menu displays, enter the number which corresponds to the option you would like to choose. Continue doing this until you are ready to quit the application and then simply choose option 5 to exit the application.
